Started Step 4 prototype for the project. Much credit goes to coding with Mitch's 2018 tutorial which has thus far provided the
basis for the project. The group members thus far had to update and refactor the existing code base to work with JetPack and
such. Additionally the Firebase backend and Google APIs were set up and enabled.

Finished off the Map component of the base application. We have added several features to start distinguishing the application from the open source code provided. Including the ability to delete chat rooms from database by entering their name, a splash screen, prompts to indicate whether the user is a driver or a passenger and a message that indicates their intent in the chat room.
Things to consider moving forward are:

* Limiting the naming of the chat rooms to dates / destinations
* On map click additions of destination markers
* Ensuring no identically named chatrooms 
* directions to destination markers
* DRIVER ability to indicate price
