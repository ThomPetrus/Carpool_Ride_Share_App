Started Step 4 prototype for the project. Much credit goes to coding with Mitch's 2018 tutorial which has thus far provided the
basis for the project. The group members thus far had to update and refactor the existing code base to work with JetPack and
such. Additionally the Firebase backend and Google APIs were set up and enabled.
